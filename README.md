# GENDER-AGE-DETETECTION
Detect gender from voice and Detect age from image data 
Gender recognition and age detection are important problems in telephone speech
processing to investigate the identity of an individual using voice characteristics. Gender
classification is one of the major problems in field of speech analysis now-a-days.
Identification of gender from acoustic properties of voice i.e. mean, median, frequency etc.
is the highly important. Machine learning is used to solve this problem because it gives
promising results for classification techniques. There are several algorithms that can be used
to predict the gender using acoustic properties. In our project, we are evaluating classifiers
using 6 different machine learning algorithms. These algorithms include K-Nearest
Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine
(SVM), Support Vector Machine Using Poly kernel and Gradient Boosting (GB). The main
parameter involved is the accuracy obtained using all these classifiers. We are trying to
assess the accuracy, recall, precision and F1 Score obtained after predicting on test data
for all these classifiers and finally the best fit model will be generated for gender classification
of acoustic data.
In age detection, a convolutional neural network was trained in order to estimate the age of
a person, based on his voice. A Convolutional Neural Network designed from scratch trained
using Keras framework that categorizes images of people based on their ages. The model
categorizes the input image based on three categories- Young , Middle and Old.
